\chapter{Tracking non-stationary systems}

\section{Non-stationary case}

When identifying a non-stationary system, a problem arises in treating all data points equally.
Since the system changes with time, older samples provide less useful information, and may even
throw off the estimation from the current true value. As such, forgetting strategies have to be implemented.
These forgetting strategies apply consecutively smaller weights to older samples.
