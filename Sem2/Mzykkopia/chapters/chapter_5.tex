\chapter{Non-parametric estimation of regression function using the kernel method}
\section{Introduction}
Another way to estimate a regression function, without resorting to orthonormal series expansion,
is to use a kernel function.
Assuming as before:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{R}(u) = \frac{\hat{g}(u)}{\hat{f}(u)} =   \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} y_k K( \frac{u_k-u}{h}) }{   \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} K( \frac{u_k-u}{h}) }
\end{equation}
Where $K(\cdot)$ is a kernel function, which only takes into account local samples to estimate local behaviour.\\
For the sixth laboratory class this method will be used to estimate the regression function of a Hammerstein system.
There were 2 linearities to approximate, depending on which group we were assigned to, and the one estimated in this rapport is the right one.
