\nt{the test command allows to see what each numerically described line type and line width mean}
\nt{keywords can be abbreviated, and all commands can be found in the manual invoked by calling \textit{help}}
\nt{to plot multiple curves, call the plot command with multiple curves separated by a period.}
\nt{It may be useful to change the output of gnuplot to different types of terminals, or files, or whatever. \\
    There are 3 mani outputs: STDOUT, a file with a name, and a pipe.
\nt{When a file is chosen as the output, the display command needs to be executed on the file to see the output}}
