\section{Introduction}
\ex{}
{
    A country recieves a certain amount of money in aid. This support can be used in two ways: \textit{consumption} and \textit{investment}
    \[
    \begin{cases}
        u(t) \text{ -- an increment growth at the time instant t}\\
        1-u(t) \text{-- the consumption growth}\\
        x(t) \text{-- a country level of development at the time instant t}
    \end{cases}
    .\] 
    There is a relationship between x and u:
    \begin{equation}
        \dot{x}(t) = u(t),\; u(t) \in [0,1],\; x(0)=x_0,\: x(T)=x_T
    \end{equation}
    The time interval $[0,T]$ is called the planning period, and  $x_T$ is the desired level of development at t=T
    We would like to make investment that guarantee achieving the desiered level of development of our country
    but at the same time we would like to spend on consumption as much money as possible.

    \begin{equation}
        I(u(\cdot)) = \int_0^TU(1-u(t))dt
    \end{equation}
    where $U\,:\,\mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R} $, $U\in C^{2}$ (convex) is a consumption development function.

    \nt
    {
        We are interested in $u^{*: [0,1] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}}$ s.t.
        $I(u^{*}(\cdot))$ is maximised.
        Also, we want to satisfy the following constraint:
        \begin{equation}
            \dot{x} = u(t),\; u(t) \in[0,1], x(0) = x_0, x(T) = x_T
        \end{equation}

        We now have a well defined problem
    }

    Economy, two sectors:
    \begin{enumerate}
            \item Investment goods
            \item Consumption goods
    \end{enumerate}
    Also, $x_i(t)$ is the production in the i-th sector at the time instant t,
    and  $u(t)$ is the investment growth in goods in the sector 1.
    The relation between  $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be descrived as follows:
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{cases}
            \dot{x}_1(t) = au(t)x_1(t)\\
            \dot(x)_2 = b(1-u(t))x_1(t)

        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    Where:\\
    \[
    0 \le u(t) \le 1\\
    t \in[0,T] -- \text{ a planning period}
    .\] 
    Our goal is to maximze the total production of consumption goods.
    To do so we introduce the following cost criterion:
    \begin{equation}
        I(u(\cdot)) = \int_0^{T}x_2(t)dt
    \end{equation}
    where:
    \[
        x_1(0) = x_{10} > 0\\
        x_2(0) = x_{20} >0
    .\] 
    But $x_1(T)$ and $x_2(T)$ are not specified(they are free).\\
    We are looking for $u^{*}(\cdot) = \argmax{I(u(\cdot))}$
    Subjet to the previously stated constraints. The difference between this and the previous examples is that here the boundaries are free.
    So this is not a Cauchy problem.

{Linear Quadratic Controller}
{
   We have 
   \[
       \dot{x}=Ax+Bu
   .\] 
   And want to optimize the following functional:
   \begin{equation}
       I(u(\cdot)) = \int_0^{T}\begin{bmatrix}
           x^{T} & u^{T}
       \end{bmatrix}
       \begin{bmatrix}
           G & N \\
           N^{T} & R
       \end{bmatrix}
       \begin{bmatrix}
           x \\
           u
       \end{bmatrix}
       dt
   \end{equation}
   where $G = G^{T} \ge 0$ and $R = R^{T} > 0$ $x(0) = x_0$, $x(T) = x_T$ and we admit  $T = \infty$

{Minimal Time Control}
{
    A company would like to achieve production $x(t)$ at a certain level $\bar{x}$ in the shortest possible time.
    But the technology needed for the production has to be improved:
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{cases}
        K(t) \text{ -- total capital invested at time t}\\
        y(t) \text{ -- a stream of import at the time instant t}\\
        y(t) = \dot{K}(t)\\
        x(t) = \alpha K(t)\\
        \dot{y}(t) = u(t) \text{ -- a control variable}\\
        u_0 \le u(t) \le u_1
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    The criterion then is:
    \begin{equation}
        I(u(\cdot)) = \int_0^{t_k}1dt=t_k
    \end{equation}

}


\dfn{Optimal Control Problem}
{
    We have:
    \begin{equation}
        \dot{x} = f(x,u),\; u\,:\,[0,T] \longrightarrow U \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \text{ -- a piecewise continuous function} 
    \end{equation}
    And a cost criterion:
    \begin{equation}
        I(u(\cdot),x_0) \text{ -- for every $u(\cdot)$ and  $x_0$ I has to be well defined on $\mathbb{R}$}
    \end{equation}
    We say that $u^{*}(\cdot)$ is optimal if $I(u^{*}(\cdot),x_0) \le I(u(\cdot),x_0)$
    We can take into account a boundary condition: $x(T,x_0,u(\cdot))=x_T$.
    The optimal control problem can be formulated as follows:\\
    The cost criterion J, a boundary condition and a set of admissible control signals $u(\cdot)$ are given.
    Find -- if it is possible -- the signal  $u^{*}(t)$ that minimizes the cost criterion J subject
    to the boundary conditions.
}

\thm{Maximum Pontryagin's Principle}
{
    Let $J(u(\cdot)) = \int^{t_f}_0 f_0(x,u)dt$ be a cost criterion that we would like to minimize.\\
    Define:
    \[
    H(x,\lambda,u) = \lambda^{T}f(x,u)-f_0(x,u)

    .\]
    If $u^{*}$ is the optimal input signal then there exist $x^{*}$ and $\lambda^{*}$ which are the solutions of:
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{cases}
            \dot{x} = \pdv{H}{\lambda}(x,\lambda,u)\\
            \dot{\lambda} = - \pdv{H}{X}(x,\lambda,u)
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    Such that:
    \begin{equation}
        H(x^{*}(t),\lambda^{*}(t),u^{*}(t)) = \max_u{H(x^{*}(t),\lambda^{*}(t),u)} = 0
    \end{equation}
}

\ex{Minimum input energy control}
{
    Let:
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{cases}
            \dot{x} = Ax +Bu,\;\; (\dot{x}=f(x,u),\; f(x,u)=Ax+Bu)\\
            x(0) = x_0\\
            x(t_f) = x_{t_f}\\
            I(u(\cdot)) = \frac{1}{2}\int^{t_f}_0 u^{T}(t)u(t)dt ,\;\; (f_0(x,u) = \frac{1}{2}u^{T}(t)u(t))
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    We would like to find $u^{*}$ that minimises $I(u(\cdot))$ and moves own control system from  $x_0$ to $x_f$ within the time interval $[0,t_f]$.\\
    To solve the problem we are going to use the Maximum Pontryagin Principle.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $X(x,\lambda,u) = \lambda^{T}(Ax+Bu) - \frac{1}{2}u^{T}u$\\
        \item $\dot{x} = \pdv{H}{\lambda}(x,\lambda,u) = Ax+Bu $\\
            $\dot{\lambda} = - \pdv{H}{x}(x,\lambda,u) = -A^{T}\lambda$
        \item $H(x^{*},\lambda^{*},u^{*}) = \max_u{\lambda^{*^{T}}(Ax^{*}+\lambda^{*^{T}}u)-\frac{1}{2}u^{T}u} $\\
            $ \pdv{H}{u}(x^{*},\lambda^{*},u^{*}) = 0 = B^{T}\lambda - u$ \\
            $u^{*} = B^{T}\lambda^{*}$

        \item $\dot{\lambda}^{*} = - A^{T}\lambda \rightarrow \lambda^{*}(t) = e^{-A^{T}t}\lambda(0)$ \\
            $u^{*} = B^{T}e^{-A^{T}t}\lambda(0)$
    \end{enumerate}
 
    Given the above we know, that $x(t)$ has the following form:
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{cases}
        x(t) = e^{At}x(0) + \int_0^{t}e^{A(t-\tau}u(\tau)d\tau\\
        x(t_f) = e^{At_f}x(0) +(\int_0^{t_f}e^{At_f-\tau}BB^{T}e^{-A^{T}\tau}d\tau)\lambda(0)\\
        w(t_f) = \int_0^{t_f}e^{At_f-\tau}BB^{T}e^{-A^{T}\tau}d\tau)\
        \end{cases}

           
    \end{equation}
    We can use the above to find $\lambda(0)$:
     \begin{equation}
        
        \begin{aligned}
            x(t_f) &= e^{At_f}x(0) +e^{At_f}w(t_f)\lambda(0)\\
            e^{-At_f}x(t_f) &= x(0) + w(t_f)\lambda(0)\\
            \lambda(0)&= w^{-1}(t_f)(e^{-At_f}x(t_f)-x(0))
            
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    From which we finaly get:
    \begin{equation}
        u^{*}(t) = B^{T}e^{-A^{T}t}w^{-1}(t_f)(e^{-At_f}x(t_f)-x(0))
    \end{equation}
    \nt
    {
        \begin{itemize}
            \item u is a direct function of time,
            \item u is not a function of x. It is not a feedback control it is OPEN LOOP CONTROL!!!!
        \end{itemize}
        The maximum Pontryagin's Principle does not guarantee that the resulted optimal control signal has the  form of state feedback.\\
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{aligned}
                u(t)&=g(x(t))&\mbox{I like it!}\\[1.25ex]
                u(t)&=g(x(t),t)&\mbox{I like t but less}\\[1.25ex]
                u(t)&=g(t)&\mbox{I have to live with it(open--loop control)}\\[1.25ex]
                
            \end{aligned}
        \end{equation}
