\dfn{Tangent Vector}{A tangent vector $\bf{v}_d$ to $\bbR^3$ consists of two points of  $\bbR^3$: its vector part $\bf{v}$ and its point of application $\bf{p}$.} 

\dfn{Tangent Space}{Let $\bf{p}$ be a point in $\bbR^3$. The set $\textit{T}_p(\bbR^3)$ consisting of all tangent vectors that have $\bf{p}$ as point of application is called the \textit{tangent space} of $\bbR^3$ at $\bf{p}$.  }

\dfn{Vector Field}{A \textit{vector field} V on $\bbR^3$ is a function that assigns to each point $\textbf{p}$ of $\bbR^3$ a tangent vector $V(\textbf{p})$ to $\bbR^3$ at $\textbf{p}$.}
