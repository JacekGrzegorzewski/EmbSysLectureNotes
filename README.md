# EmbSysLectureNotes
Notes for Embedded Systems programme, first semester.
I've decided to upload all my notes, but the ones
of most interest are Control Theory and Applied Logic,
and since there are gaps in the latter, please provide
me with some pictures of your notes so that I can fill them.
By that I mean, create a folder called raw in the applied logic
folder, and put your notes there as either a set of pictures,
or a pdf. Later I'll aggregate them in latex.

Also, if someone could create some kind of a bot to automatically
compile and upload the notes to notion after each push that would
be great.
