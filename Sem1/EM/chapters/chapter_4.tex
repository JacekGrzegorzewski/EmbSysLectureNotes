Main features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supports the whole design process:
    \item \begin{itemize}
            \item system level
            \item RT level (Register transfer)
            \item logic level
                \item circuit level
        \end{itemize}
    \item Precise simulation semantics
    \item Suitable for specificaion both in behavioral and structural domain
\end{itemize}

\section{RTL synthesis}
We stat from a textual model, translate it int or set of gates and registers, which is later optimised.

\section{Program structure}
There are 3 parts to a program:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Libraries
    \item entities and their architecture, always 1 to 1
    \item the content -- proceses, function, etc.
\end{itemize}

\nt
{
    Port direction does not correspond to the physical port direction. VHDL is a high level language, so the direction
    is specified on a high level, not on software level.
}

\subsection{Datatapes}
In VHDL a type of datatapes called enumerated plays a very important role.
\nt
{
    STD_LOGIC -- this is more or less a bit with a couple of extra features\\
    STD_LOGIC_VECTOR -- this is a vector of  bits, so a word for example
}

\subsection{Entity}
An entity has the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Port -- not technically necessary, but useless without it
    \item Generic -- a means to poass specific information into an entity(This allows for example to create a universal parity checker)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Architecture}
\nt{VHDL is a case insensitive language}
\subsubsection{Signal}
        declared as -- name: type := value;(VARIABLES CAN ONLY BE INITIALIZED IN SIMULATION, NOT SYNTHESIS)
\subsubsection{Constant}
        Used for readability, declared the same way as a signal
\subsubsection{Type}
    \nt
    {
        In VHDL enumerations have no values assigned to them, they are referred to by their names
    }
    \subsubsection{Everything else}
    \begin{itemize}
            \item Component declarations
            \item Subtype declarations
            \item Attribute declarations
            \item Attribute specifications
            \item Subprogram declarations
            \item Subprogram body
            
    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Body}
