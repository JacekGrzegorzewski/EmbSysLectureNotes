    \section{Rank of a matrix}
    When calculating the rank of a matrix, all minors have to be taken into account, including those of non adjacent vectors. This means that an $n\times n$ matrix has  $n^{2}$ minors. This is quiet a lot, so you can calculate the rank using a different method, like row echolon decomposition. 
    \section{Linearization}
        The linearization formula is correct, but it has to be stated, that there is also a constant term at the beginning, which happens to be zero at the 
        equilibrium point. In general however, it is not zero.
