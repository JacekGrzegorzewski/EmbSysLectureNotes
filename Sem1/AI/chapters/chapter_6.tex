\subsection{Overfitting}
Overfitting is the phenomena of training a model to some very specific pattern very well, which however doesn't
generalize. This results in high accuracy on the testing set, but low on all others. 
\section{detection}
A simple approach to detect, or rather combat, overfitting is to acquire more quality data.
Another more general approach is the early stopping method. It works by comparing the performance of the testing set
with performance on the validation set. Once the performance on the validation set starts to decrease, we're entering
overfitting territory and have to stop training.
\subsection{Underfitting}
On the other side of the spectrum we have underfitting, which result in a similar discrepancy between diferent
datasets.
